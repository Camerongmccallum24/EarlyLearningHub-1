# DigitalOcean Deployment Checklist

## Pre-Deployment Verification

### ✅ Codebase Ready
- [x] Replit dependencies removed from package.json
- [x] Clean .gitignore configured
- [x] .doignore excludes unnecessary files
- [x] app.yaml App Platform configuration created
- [x] Health check endpoint at `/health` implemented
- [x] Environment variables documented in .env.example
- [x] Database connection configured for managed PostgreSQL
- [x] Static file serving optimized for production
- [x] Compression middleware added
- [x] Port configuration uses environment variable

### ✅ Files Streamlined
- [x] Docker files excluded via .doignore (not needed for App Platform)
- [x] Replit-specific files excluded (.replit, replit.nix)
- [x] attached_assets folder excluded
- [x] Build artifacts cleaned
- [x] Only essential files included for GitHub export

### ✅ Configuration Files
- [x] `app.yaml` - App Platform service configuration
- [x] `.gitignore` - Git exclusions for clean repository
- [x] `.doignore` - App Platform deployment exclusions
- [x] `.env.example` - Environment variable template
- [x] `README.md` - Project documentation
- [x] `DIGITALOCEAN_DEPLOYMENT.md` - Deployment guide
- [x] `prepare-deployment.sh` - Deployment preparation script

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Repository Setup
```bash
# Clean and prepare
./prepare-deployment.sh

# Commit to GitHub
git add .
git commit -m "Streamlined for DigitalOcean App Platform deployment"
git push origin main
```

### 2. DigitalOcean App Platform
1. Create new App Platform application
2. Connect to GitHub repository
3. Configure build settings:
   - Build Command: `npm run build`
   - Run Command: `npm start`
   - Environment: Node.js

### 3. Environment Variables
Set in App Platform > Settings > Environment Variables:
```
NODE_ENV=production
PORT=8080
DATABASE_URL=${managed-database.DATABASE_URL}
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key
SESSION_SECRET=your_secure_secret
```

### 4. Database Setup
- Add managed PostgreSQL database (version 15)
- Database URL automatically injected as DATABASE_URL
- Initialize with job data after deployment

### 5. Verification
- Deployment succeeds without errors
- Health check responds at `/health`
- Application loads correctly
- Database connection established
- Job listings display properly

## Key Features Preserved

### ✅ Core Functionality
- Job search and filtering
- Application submission system
- AI-powered career assistant
- Interactive location maps
- Mobile-responsive design
- Real-time job updates

### ✅ Technical Features
- React SPA with client-side routing
- Express API server
- PostgreSQL database with Drizzle ORM
- OpenAI integration for career insights
- Compression and caching optimizations
- Health monitoring endpoint

### ✅ Security & Performance
- Environment variable management
- Secure session handling
- Static asset caching
- Gzip compression
- Database connection pooling
- Error handling and logging

## Post-Deployment

### Monitoring
- Monitor deployment logs for errors
- Verify database connectivity
- Test job application submission
- Validate AI assistant functionality

### Optional Enhancements
- Custom domain configuration
- SSL certificate (auto-managed by App Platform)
- Scaling configuration based on traffic
- Log forwarding setup
- Backup verification

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- **Build Failures**: Check Node.js version compatibility
- **Database Errors**: Verify DATABASE_URL configuration
- **Environment Variables**: Ensure all required secrets are set
- **Static Assets**: Verify build output directory structure

### Debug Steps
1. Check deployment logs in App Platform console
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Test health endpoint: `https://your-app.ondigitalocean.app/health`
4. Monitor application runtime logs
